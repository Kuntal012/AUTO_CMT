Rdseed Version 4.7

	This is the SEED reader program as distributed by the IRIS DMC.
	The version will read SEED volumes up to version 2.4

	The distribution includes all sources needed for compiling for the 
	host computer.

	The current version is developed for the Sun computer, but should be
	compatible for other UNIX systems as well.

	
Installation:
	
	program name: rdseed

	Use the tar command to "extract" binary and sources, i.e:
		tar -xvf rdseed.tar .

	(You already must have done this in order to be reading this now)

	This will yield a top level directory named rdseed with
	an executable, along with other miscellaneous files.

	The C source files are located in the sub-directories.

	Rename the appropriate executable for your operating system to rdseed 
	and place in your path.
	
	To install without "make":
		change directory to rdseed

		simply copy rdseed into user's path. 	

		copy the man pages rdseed.l into the man directory, typically
		/usr/man/man? 

	To recompile:	
		change directory to rdseed

		First to make sure we have a "clean" tar version, enter :
			make clean
				at the command line.

		Edit the makefile's LDFLAGS variable to either:

			Sun OS : LDFLAGS = -lm -lc

		or
			Solaris : LDFLAGS = -lm -lc -lnsl

		Comment out one or the other entry in the makefile as
		is appropriate for your system.

		Then enter:
			make

				at the command line.

		After a few minutes you will have an executable for your 
		machine.
	
		Again, copy executable into your path, plus add the man page to
		your man page directory as described above.
